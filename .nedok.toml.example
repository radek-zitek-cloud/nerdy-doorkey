# SSH Credentials
# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING: Passwords are stored in PLAINTEXT - NOT SECURE!
#
# RECOMMENDED: Use SSH agent with key-based authentication instead:
#   1. Generate SSH key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
#   2. Copy to server: ssh-copy-id user@host
#   3. Start SSH agent: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
#   4. Add key: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#   5. Connect without password!
#
# This section is auto-populated when you save credentials after connecting
# Best practice: Only save username, leave password empty, use SSH agent
[ssh.credentials]
# Format:
# [ssh.credentials."hostname.example.com"]
# username = "myuser"
# password = "mypassword"  # ⚠️  PLAINTEXT - not secure!

# Example (username only - secure):
# [ssh.credentials."server.local"]
# username = "admin"
# # No password - will use SSH agent keys

# Session State
# Automatically saved when you exit the browser
# Restored when you launch without specifying directories
# SSH connections are also saved and auto-reconnected if possible
[session]
left_directory = "."
right_directory = "."

# SSH connection states (auto-populated)
# left_ssh and right_ssh are saved when you exit with remote connections active
# [session.left_ssh]
# hostname = "server.example.com"
# username = "myuser"
# remote_directory = "/home/myuser/projects"

# [session.right_ssh]
# hostname = "another-server.com"
# username = "admin"
# remote_directory = "/var/www"
