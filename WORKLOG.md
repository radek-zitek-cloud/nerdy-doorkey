# Work Log

- 2025-11-06: Performed a full code review of the dual-pane browser, catalogued defects and improvement opportunities in `CODE_REVIEW.md`. Executed `PYTHONPATH=. pytest` to ensure the test suite still passes (initial run without PYTHONPATH failed to locate the package). No further issues encountered.
